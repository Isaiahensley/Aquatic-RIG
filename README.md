# Aquatic-RIG
Our Senior Capstone project focuses on developing a Streamlit website dedicated to the visualization of aquatic data. Aquatic data is inherently complex, being both spatiotemporalâ€”capturing information over different times and locations. Our website will let users adjust the time and coordinate locations to have the graphs change dynamically in real-time. This will allow complex data files such as .nc files to be easy and intuitive to visualize.
