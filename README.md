# Aquatic-RIG
Our Senior Capstone project focuses on developing a Streamlit website dedicated to the visualization of aquatic data for aquatic researchers. Aquatic data is inherently complex, being both spatiotemporalâ€”capturing information over different times and locations. Our website lets users adjust the time and depth where data is collected and have the graphs change dynamically in real time. This allows complex data files such as NetCDF files to be easy and intuitive to visualize.
